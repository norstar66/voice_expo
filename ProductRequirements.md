## Introduction

### Purpose

- The purpose of this product is to provide a voice-driven coordination and assistance system for Commercial Kitchens by supporting inventory, prep, expo which is fully integrated with the Toast POS on low cost Android-based tablets and voice activated Raspberry Pie. 
    
    Designed to improve: 
    - communication, 
    - reduce errors, 
    - accelerate ticket ﬂow, and
    - support line-staff performance by delivering: 
        - spoken cues, 
        - alerts, and 
        - station updates in real time.


### Problem statement

- In high-volume kitchen environments, communication breakdowns, station confusion, delay in item tracking, and ticket mismanagement lead to wasted labor, spoilage, longer service times, and frustrated staff. Traditional KDS displays alone do not address verbal
coordination, interruption handling, or dynamic station rebalancing. This product intends to ﬁll that gap by enabling a voice-agent “expo” that listens, announces, and coordinates
across stations, thereby reducing ineﬃciencies and improving throughput.

### Target audience

Primary users are kitchen staff (line cooks, station leads, runners, expo) and management at full-service restaurants using Toast POS.

- Demographics: mid‐sized independent restaurants (single or small multi-location) with Android tablets at each station, 20-100 seats, 10-30 staff on shift.

### Pain Points:

- Station-to-station miscommunication

-  Tickets are piling up at one station, while others are idling

-  Manual verbal calls (“all coquilles up!”, “fry needs backup!”, etc.)

-  Lack of standardized voice cues or alerts

-  Diﬃculty gathering production data for training or menu optimization

### Needs:

-  Hands-free, real-time coordination

- Immediate announcements of tickets per station

-  Voice commands for station cleanup, hold items, expedite

-  Easy integration with existing POS/KDS without replacing hardware

## Objectives

### Goals

1. Reduce average ticket-to-ﬁre time by 20% within the ﬁrst pilot.

2. Decrease inter-station communication breakdowns (measured via incident logs or staff feedback) by 90%.

3. Improve labor eﬃciency by enabling station leads to spend less time shouting or running tasks and more time focused on execution.

4. Provide data-driven insights into station performance, enabling management to identify bottlenecks and optimize menu items.

5. Create a scalable foundation for future voice-agent features (training modules, predictive station loads, voice-activated prep notiﬁcations).

### Non-goals

1. This document does NOT cover full guest-voice ordering (take-out, phone, kiosks) — the scope is internal kitchen coordination.

2. It does not replace the primary KDS system or Toast POS; it augments it.

3. It does not cover hardware procurement (tablets, speakers) beyond minimal
recommendations.

4. It does not address integration with loyalty, payment processing, or guest interface at this stage.

## Metrics

### Quantitative Metrics

-  Time from order receipt in Toast to “item started” at station (baseline vs 
post-deploy).

-  Number of tickets per station in back-log at any given time (reduction of peak stacking).

-  Number of staff verbal interruptions/alerts per shift (tracked via app log).

-  Waste/spoilage incidents attributable to missed tickets or delays (reduction target).

-  Staff training time for new line-cooks (reduced by 30%).

-  Number of menu items identiﬁed as low-ROI through station tracking data within 30 days post-deploy.

### Qualitative Metrics

-  Staff satisfaction with communication during service (survey before/after).

-  Station lead perception of workload and coordination (interviews).

-  Management feedback on ease of obtaining station performance data and
insights.

-   Instances of “guest wait complaint” due to station delays (reduced number).

-  Narrative feedback from the kitchen team on how the voice expo impacted their shift ﬂow.

# Copilot / AI Agent Instructions

Purpose: help AI coding agents be productive in this repo by describing
the architecture, build/test/debug workflows, conventions, and integration
points. Update the placeholders below with repository-specific values.

## Quick Orientation
- **Language / Runtime:** <e.g. Node.js 18 / Python 3.11 / Go 1.20>
- **Primary entry points:** `<path/to/server>`, `<path/to/cli>`, `<path/to/main>`
- **Top-level directories:** update these to match your repo: `src/`, `pkg/`, `services/`, `frontend/`, `infra/`, `scripts/`

## Big Picture Architecture (fill in specifics)
- **Major components:**
  - `<component-a>` — responsibility, where code lives (e.g. `services/auth/*`).
  - `<component-b>` — responsibility, where code lives (e.g. `frontend/*`).
- **Service boundaries / data flows:** briefly explain how data moves between components (HTTP/gRPC/messages/DB). Example: "Frontend -> API gateway (`api/`) -> auth service (`services/auth/`) -> DB (`postgres`)".
- **Why structure exists:** note design decisions (single repo monorepo for ease of changes, separate services for scalability, etc.).

## Critical Developer Workflows
- **Install / bootstrap:** replace with real command, e.g. `npm ci` or `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `make bootstrap`.
- **Build:** `<insert build command>` (examples: `npm run build`, `go build ./...`, `./gradlew assemble`).
- **Run locally:** `<insert run command>` (examples: `npm start`, `python -m servicename`, `docker compose up --build`).
- **Run tests:** `<insert test command>` (examples: `npm test`, `pytest`, `go test ./...`).
- **Debugging:** note any special env vars, debug ports, or run profiles. Example: `DEBUG=server:* nodemon --inspect index.js`.
- **CI:** update path to CI config if present (e.g. `.github/workflows/ci.yml`) and any gated checks required for PRs.

## Project-Specific Conventions & Patterns
- **File/dir patterns:** list any non-standard layouts (e.g. "API routes live in `api/routes/*` not `src/`", or "services are named `svc-<name>`").
- **Testing patterns:** e.g. use of feature tests vs unit tests, mocks located at `tests/mocks/`, test data fixtures at `tests/fixtures/`.
- **Config & secrets:** where to find templates (e.g. `config/*.example`, `.env.template`) and how secrets are provided in CI.
- **Logging and tracing:** how to find traces (e.g. `otel` config file), and standard log format (JSON/structured).

## Integration Points / External Dependencies
- **Datastores:** list DB types and connection files (e.g. `pkg/db/pg.go`).
- **External APIs:** endpoints, auth methods, and client wrappers (e.g. `clients/paymentClient.js`).
- **Message buses / queues:** topics/queues names and consumer locations.

## How the Agent Should Work (practical rules)
- When making code changes, prefer small, self-contained commits and include tests that exercise the change.
- If you cannot determine an authoritative file or command, create a draft PR with a clear TODO comment and leave a short human-facing checklist in the PR description.
- Always run the repository's test command before proposing changes. If tests are slow, run the smallest relevant test subset and note why.

## Examples (replace placeholders with actual paths)
- Add a new API endpoint: update router in `<path/to/router>` and implement handler in `<path/to/handlers>`; add integration test in `<tests/integration/>` and run `<test command> --filter integration`.
- Fix failing unit test: open `<tests/unit/<module>_test.*>`, update `<module>` in `<src/module>` and run `<test command> <tests/unit/<module>_test.*>`.

## Quick Checklist for Maintainers (what agent needs to be fully specific)
1. Primary language/runtime and required versions.
2. Exact install / build / test / run commands.
3. Top-level directories map (where code, configs, infra live).
4. CI workflow file path and PR requirements.
5. Key integration endpoints and any credentials used for local dev (or how to get them).

If you want, I can: (A) scan the repo and rewrite this file with concrete examples, or (B) keep this template and iterate after you paste key paths/commands. Which do you prefer?
